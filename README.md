THIS REPO IS WIP

To run

```
yarn --ignore-engines
yarn build
yarn server
yarn start
```

To ship it

Create a file called `token` in the root, it must have a github
access token with the full `repo` permission. Then:

```./ship.sh```

note: creating the .dmg file only works when running on a mac.
